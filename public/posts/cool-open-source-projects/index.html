        <h1>cool open source projects</h1>
        <main>
    <article><p>There are a ton of cool projects online, and especially on GitHub. I know there a ton of other places, but I mostly
use GitHub, so I decided to go through my stars and share the most interesting repos.</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD">OpenTTD</a></h2>
<p>OpenTTD is a simulation game originally based on Transport Tycoon deluxe. It's genuinely a good game with solid game
mechanics and charming pixel art.</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/gqgs/3x3-generator">3x3 Generator</a></h2>
<p>This one is for the anime fans, That want to show off 9 anime in a 3x3 format. Comparable to a topster for music. This
has been helpful to me in the past, since making a 3x3 is rarely worth opening an image editing program. I also like the
multiple download options, and the fact that it is not dependent on one single image source.</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-Coding-Adventure">Chess-Coding-Adventure</a></h2>
<p>This project has motivated me to keep writing interesting projects (and more importantly, to write projects that I
enjoy). Sebastian Lague's videos are incredible, and provide a lot of insight to the programming niches he explores. You
can watch these videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague">here</a>. I especially recommend his two chess bot videos
and his fluid simulations.</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2">PCSX2</a></h2>
<p>PCSX2 is a great ps2 emulator which has been in development for 20 years. 99% percent of all playstation 2 games ever
released are at least playable on the software. It's a great project that I use myself a lot of the time. And it's a
testament to PCSX2's quality that people keep using it.</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus">Notepad++</a></h2>
<p>Notepad++ is a great lightweight text editor, that I also use a lot. I'm probably going to switch to it full time after
my Webstorm/Intellij/whatever student license runs out. The project has been continuously developed for 21 full years
and counting. There are also countless plugins that have been developed for its ecosystem.</p>
<p>My favourite features are the great binary and hex editor, the hashing functions and the export to html feature.</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/justfoolingaround/animdl">animdl</a></h2>
<p>This is a cli-app to stream and download anime. I use it daily. The only downside is the fact that you have to download
a media player and configure the program to use it, which complicates things slightly. Other than that, nothing but
praise for this project.</p>
<hr>
<p>and that's that. I have enough other projects that I could probably make this into a series. If I do, I probably won't
write another installment for a while. I hope you checked some of these projects out, because they really deserve it.</p>
