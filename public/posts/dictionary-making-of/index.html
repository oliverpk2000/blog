        <h1>Making my own dictionary website</h1>

<p>Have you ever noticed how dictionaries on the web are so bloated? Let's
use <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/">the cambridge dictionary</a> as an example. First off, at least in the
EU, you have to navigate through the standard cookies popup, which slows me down from actually looking up the definition
for a
word. Then, once you actually search a word, there is a distracting sidebar advertising other unnecessary features of
the website like, quizzes, word of the day, a blog and a new word poll. I have nothing against these features, I just
don't want them advertised to me while I'm looking up a definition. A lot of these dictionary websites try to retain
users with the other features, when in fact, to retain users, a dictionary website just has to serve accurate
explanations of words. These micro-problems I had with the state of things annoyed me, until I had a long weekend and
decided to use the project idea to learn jQuery.</p>
<p>I had a set of criteria for this website:</p>
<ul>
<li>simple, no distractions / no ads</li>
<li>quick to load</li>
<li>accurate</li>
</ul>
<p>One of my main objectives was to keep the workflow of using the site as short as possible. I wrote down all the actions
I took on the cambridge dictionary website (with cache and uBlock origin disabled) which amounted to this:</p>
<ul>
<li>accept cookies</li>
<li>search word</li>
<li>read definition</li>
<li>close ad popup because I was too slow to read everything</li>
<li>read rest of definition</li>
</ul>
<p>The amount of transferred data was also insane.</p>

<p>In what world does a dictionary need to pass through this much data? Most of it was advertisements being served to
me, and telemetry data from cookies.</p>
<p>I found that I could optimize the workflow by just removing unwanted parts. I planned for myself to be the only user,
I decided not to advertise to myself, or sell my own data through cookies which removed the biggest offenders right
away.</p>
<p>To emphasize the quick to load part, I decided to forgo a framework like Angular, React or Vue, even though I use them frequently and decided to just use
browser-side javascript for the business logic. I did however, to keep myself sane, use jQuery to handle the DOM-tree editing.</p>
<p>Accuracy was easy to accomplish, as I stumbled onto the <a href="https://dictionaryapi.dev/">free dictionary api</a>. Its fast and
up to date enough that it was very difficult to find words that didn't have an entry. It also had phonetics data which I
added to the website.</p>
