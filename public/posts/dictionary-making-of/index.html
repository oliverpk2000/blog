<p>Have you ever noticed how dictionaries on the web are so bloated? Let's
use <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/">the cambridge dictionary</a> as an example. First off, at least in the
EU, you have to navigate through the standard cookies popup, which slows me down from actually looking up the definition
for a
word. Then, once you actually search a word, there is a distracting sidebar advertising other unnecessary features of
the website like, quizzes, word of the day, a blog and a new word poll. I have nothing against these features, I just
don't want them advertised to me while I'm looking up a definition. A lot of these dictionary websites try to retain
users with the other features, when in fact, to retain users, a dictionary website just has to serve accurate
explanations of words. These micro-problems I had with the state of things annoyed me, until I had a long weekend and
decided to use the project idea to learn jQuery.</p>
<p>I had a set of criteria for this website:</p>
<ul>
<li>quick to load</li>
<li>simple, no distractions</li>
<li>accurate</li>
</ul>
<p>One of my main objectives was to keep the workflow of using the site as short as possible. I wrote down all the actions
i took on the cambridge dictionary website (with cache )which amounted to this:</p>
<p>Accuracy was easy to accomplish, as I stumbled onto the <a href="https://dictionaryapi.dev/">free dictionary api</a>. Its fast many
up to date enough that it was very difficult to find words that didn't have an entry. It also had phonetics data which I
added to the website.</p>
