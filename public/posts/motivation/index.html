        <h1>motivation</h1>
        <main>
    <article><p>I'll be honest. My motivation for writing fluctuates a lot. Just take this blog as an example. I posted daily in the
beginning, and now I have slowed down to almost monthly. And this isn't the only time it has happened. I've had other blogs
that have fizzled out after one or two posts. Now this blog has already surpassed that, but not by much.</p>
<p>And it's not just writing. It's also programming. Any project I start, I work on for a couple of days, and then I can't
find the motivation to keep going. The 90/90 rule states that when you think you're 90% done with a project, you still
have 90% of the work in front of you. But recently, it feels like I top out at 40â€“50%.</p>
<p>Deadlines seem to work, but only if they represent real repercussions, like a school project where if you submit late, your grade gets worse. Looking back, 90% of anything I have made (that's finished) has been for an internship or for
school. And honestly, it's pretty demoralizing that I need a corporate/academic environment to be motivated, since most
of my projects on GitHub/GitLab/CodeBerg/whatever will fall outside those two categories.</p>
<p>On the topic of finished projects, is a blog ever finished? In my Opinion, the software/architecture might be, but the
actual product (the blog) will never be, as long as there exists a possibility that someone starts posting again.</p>
<p>Until next time,</p>
