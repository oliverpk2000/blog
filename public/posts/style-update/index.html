    <article><p>Recently, I decided to change the styling of this website a little bit. Unfortunately, all of my changes worsened the
website. After many attempt I was at a roadblock. So I used Chatgpt. Which is something I do not do often, and I
actually thought about rolling it back. But I did like the style, however minimal the changes were. The not-by-AI
picture at the bottom of the page says that 90% of the content on this website must be created by humans, not AI. I feel
like this still applies, as only part of the styling is made by AI, not the content.</p>
<p>I know most people don't mind, but your opinion interests me. So, if you have a minute, please fill out
