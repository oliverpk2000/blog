## why

I made this blog website because I wanted to learn how to deploy a static site to GitHub pages.
I used to have a blogger blog, but it was quite terrible, and I didn't like the pre-made themes.
This website might not look much better, but I control how good (or most likely bad) it looks.

## how

it uses 11ty to generate the blog, and then a workflow script that uploads the public directory to gh-pages.
The source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/oliverpk2000/blog), just like pretty much anything I make.
